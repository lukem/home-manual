# Energy
## General

Overview of your home's energy supply: services (electricity supply, battery energy storage systems, solar systems). Our home only uses electricity (we removed the fossil methane supply in 2017), so I only documented that.

## Electricity circuits

Description of the various circuits' purposes and circuit breaker locations.
The convention I used was to number each circuit in the meter boxes and use those numbers elsewhere in the manual.

## Electricity outside diagram

Similar to [External connections diagram](#external-connections-diagram), with details of all the external electrical services, connections, etc.

This includes:
- Electricity meters.
- Battery energy storage system.
- External appliances (e.g., hot water heat pump and reverse cycle air conditioner), and their circuit breakers.
- Solar systems, inverters, circuit breakers.
 
## Electricity inside diagram

Location of each GPO (power point) and hard-wired appliance (such as cooktop, hot-water heat pump, oven), and which circuit they're on.
Add notes for special cases (e.g., GPO inside a cupboard, switches for a hard-wired appliance co-located in a GPO, etc.)

## Lights inside diagram

Location of each light fixture and its switch, and which circuit they're on. I also documented exhaust fans that are co-located with lights (share a switch or switch panel).

The convention I used to was to use a letter group for each collection of lights/fans and their switches. E.g. A switch labeled "A:1" means switch for light fixture A on circuit 1, and its light fixture was labeled "A".

## Electricity network

Table with details of our electricity network (wholesale) provider - who to call in an outage.
