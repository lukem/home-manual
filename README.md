# Home Manual

## Introduction

This repository contains advice and templates for documenting your home in a *Home manual*, for yourself as well as any other users of your home.

My goals are to encourage you to document important information about living in your home, for day-to-day purposes as well as when emergencies occur.

This repository will contain templates outlining the recommended information to including in a *Home manual*. I currently don't intend to provide templates for specific document software (Apple Pages, Microsoft Word), because the principles are more important.

## Templates

## Password managers

Use a good password manager for your personal passwords and information.

Setup a "shared family" section with entries including:
- Household services (energy, internet, water)
- Insurance documents (home, car)
- Wifi passwords

 We currently use [1Password](https://1password.com), but others such as [bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com) are also well regarded.


## Motivation

Over recent years a couple of friends have unexpectedly lost their partners. Aside from their grief, important knowledge about how their home operated was lost or hard to find.

My beloved wife Inger (AKA [Thesis Whisperer](https://thesiswhisperer.com)) and I discussed me writing a "*Home manual*" documenting important and useful information about our home, because most of the information was either in my head or spread across years of email messages in my personal mail account.

I wrote the initial version of our *Home manual* over the summer break of December 2022 - January 2023, and it's currently 30 pages of documentation and diagrams.
