# Home Manual

## Introduction

This repository contains advice and templates for documenting your home in a *Home manual*, for yourself as well as any other users of your home.

My goal is to encourage you to document important information about living in your home, for day-to-day purposes as well as when emergencies occur.

This repository contains templates outlining the recommended information to include in your *Home manual*.

## Motivation

Over recent years a couple of friends have unexpectedly lost their partners. Aside from their grief, important knowledge about how their home operated was lost or hard to find.

My beloved wife Inger (AKA [Thesis Whisperer](https://thesiswhisperer.com)) and I discussed me writing a "*Home manual*" documenting important and useful information about our home, because most of the information was either in my head or spread across years of email messages in my personal mail account.

I wrote the initial version of our *Home manual* over the summer break of December 2022 - January 2023, and it's currently 30 pages of documentation and diagrams.

## General advice

- Keep the *Home manual* up to date.
- Documentation:
  - Information to maintain for a service provider:
     - Contact information
     - Account numbers (unless you consider it sensitive like a password - see below).
  - Don't store sensitive information such as passwords - use a [password manager](#password-managers). A reference to the relevant entry in the password manager entry is sensible.
- Diagrams:
  - These don't need to be architectural, construction, or engineering grade. The important point is to contain information useful to lay-people. My diagrams are specifically "not to scale".
  - Maintain layers (if your diagram software supports layers) for:
     - External property plan.
     - Internal home plan.
     - Services: electricity, garden, IoT, lights, network, water/sewer, (etc.)
- Software:
  - Use software and tools that are useable and maintainable by your household. Our household all has at least one personal iOS or macOS device, so I used Apple Pages. Google Docs or Microsoft Word are other options.
  - Export to PDF and store in well-known locations.
  - Print the manual and store in a well-known location. Even just the first few pages with emergency and critical information can be helpful.
  
  
## Password managers

Use a good password manager for your personal passwords and information.

Setup a "Shared family" section (... shared with your family) with entries including:
- Household services (energy, internet, water)
- Insurance documents (home, car)
- Wifi passwords

We currently use [1Password](https://1password.com), but others such as [bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com) are also well regarded.
